    <h5 class="card-title">Cultural Conflict</h5>
    <p class="card-text">My research queries the dynamics of navigating multiple cultural spaces in literatures that explore the concepts of leaving Africa, returning to Africa, and belonging to Africa. But even more specifically, I interrogate the tensions that arise when continental Africans and African Americans return to Africa from the Diaspora hoping to connect or reconnect to their roots. I examine the tensions that exist between colonial and African cultures on the African continent. In examining these topics, I am interested in how African and Diaspora writers theorize Afropolitanism, Afropolitans, the cultural crisis they face, and how they navigate spaces where they are often seen as the ‘other.’</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Ethnicity and Race</h5>
    <p class="card-text">I am interested in the concept of Blackness. My research examines the question; who is Black, and what is Black(ness)? For decades now, Blackness has been defined by Western philosophies, thinkers, and worldviews as that which has a connection to Africa. Once Africa comes in the contexts, Blackness then by default is associated with slavery, poverty, colonialism, uncivilization, violence, and backwardness. Blackness's connection with Africa is a Eurocentric, imperial, and separatist notion that seeks to create a superior versus inferior discourse; or rather, the binarism of “we” and “them,” where “them” refers to the “Other.” Western discourses on Blackness aims to isolate Black consciousness from the collective human consciousness. With this isolation, Black humanness is presented as incapacitated. In the attempt to present and maintain Western notions of rationality as superior and more relevant than Black subjects' rationality, scholarships by Black scholars that challenge this mode of thinking are often ignored in the mainstream Western academic discourses. Therefore, my research focus is on the question; how can the Black subjects recover their essence and get themselves out of this pandora box? How can they free themselves from the traumatic nightmares that emanate from the memories of historical erasure and the plantionocene?</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Ecocriticism </h5>
    <p class="card-text">In ecocriticism, I am really interested in the space between humans and nonhumans. I grapple with questions such as; how can/do humans and nonhumans interact with each other harmoniously in the ecosystem? How does human and nonhuman life affect each other? What tensions exist between the two species, and how can it be solved? In most cases, eco-critics often take nonhumans as the default victims of human action in the Anthropocene.  They mainly concentrate on how humans jumble with the ecosystem and the repercussion of that interference, without considering how both species affect and get affected by one another. My research focuses on the multi-spectival nature of ecocriticism. In line with the contemporary eco-critics like Haraway, Nixon, Cavendish, Lanyer, Mbembe, Hamilton, Nardizzi, Bennet, Glotfelty, and Shiva, I consider the ecosystem as a community of humans, animals, and nonliving things. It is made up of many communities, on earth, beneath, and in space. I focus on the connections and disconnections that exist between these communities in the ecosystem. I am also interested in the eco-specific language that is used to express eco-concepts; beginning with the coining of the term ecocriticism in the late 20th century, and other terms such as cyborg, ecofeminism, and eco-materialism just to mention a few. I explore and unpack the terminologies and the language that expresses this ever-expanding field. </p>
